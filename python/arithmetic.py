This module provides basic arithmetic operations.

Functions:
    Addition: Adds two numbers.
    Subtraction: Subtracts the second number from the first.
    Multiplication: Multiplies two numbers.
    Division (float): Divides the first number by the second, resulting in a float.
    Division (floor): Divides the first number by the second, resulting in an integer (floor division).
    Modulus: Returns the remainder of the division of the first number by the second.
    Exponent: Raises the first number to the power of the second.

Usage:
    This module can be used to perform basic arithmetic operations in educational settings or simple calculations.
